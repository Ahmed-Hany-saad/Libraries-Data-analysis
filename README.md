# Global Country Statistics Data Analysis

This repository contains data cleaning and visualization work on global country statistics, including population, GDP, and other relevant indicators. The data has been organized by region and processed to create a clean, interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to clean and analyze the country-level statistical data provided in an Excel file, followed by creating visual representations in Tableau for better insights and analysis.

### Steps Taken

1. **Data Cleaning in Excel**: 
   - Removed any duplicates or incorrect entries.
   - Ensured consistency in formatting (e.g., numerical formatting for population and GDP values).
   - Standardized country names and regions for better categorization.
   - Handled any missing or incomplete data points, ensuring that they don't skew the results.

2. **Dashboard Creation in Tableau**:
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau.
   - Designed an interactive dashboard that provides users with an easy way to explore the data visually.
   - The dashboard allows users to filter data by region, population, and other factors to gain deeper insights.
